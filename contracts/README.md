# Ethereum Maths Bounty Contracts

An experiment in rewarding mathematical progress.

Anyone can send funds to the contracts, and when solutions are found, the contract pays out the prize to the first successful entry.

## The 33 problem

Very simply, the formula `33 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3` has no known solutions. If you find one, sending the correct a, b and c values to the 33 ethereum contract (address to be added here soon) will pay out the value of the contract to you.
