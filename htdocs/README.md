bigprimes.net
======

Initial commit of php code powering bigprimes.net. This code is procedural and untestable. I have open sourced it now to force me to make the time and fix this codebase.

Goals
===

Remove redundent code.
Organise code into logical folders.
Get code to the point where we can run unit tests.
100% test coverage.
